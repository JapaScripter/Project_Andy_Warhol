				<h2 class="tt_2">What are the topics presented?</h2>
				<p class="tx_2">The themes are politics with Mao Tse Tung, the Chinese dictator, death with the electric chair (a common means of executing death row in Andy's time), decontextualization of art with oxidation and even immortalization of important people and artists (such as John Kennedy's wife after his death).</p>

			<div class="dv_3">
				<h2 class="tt_3">What caught the group's attention/perception the most? Why?</h2>
				<p class="tx_3">O que mais foi significativo para mim foi a imagem do ditador Mao Tse Tung, visto que ele é uma figura política do outro lado do mundo, não imaginei que Andy Warhol iria entrar com tanta ênfase na narrativa política, logo percebo que Andy era muito mais antenado ao que acontecia no mundo do que eu esperava de um artista.What was most significant to me was the image of the dictator Mao Tse Tung, since he is a political figure on the other side of the world, I didn't imagine that Andy Warhol would enter with such emphasis on the political narrative, I soon realized that Andy was much more in tune with what was happening in the world than I expected from an artist.</p>

			<h2 class="tt_4">How can the exhibition help to understand and apply the concepts? Cite and justify each answer with examples:</h2>
			<div class="dv_4">
				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Borboletas.jpg" alt="Borboletas">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Project</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">A project is about something less perfect and more human, so to speak, like in Warhol's art, many repeated images as well as different techniques or even the same technique applied in different ways creating new images, new contexts, new ideas, like a painting of butterflies that had several butterflies of different shapes and sizes and even different colors as well as collages of other butterflies from another canvas, the repetition in creating the butterfly, but in so many different ways or the same in some ways, but different in others.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Passaros.jpeg" alt="Passaros">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Portfolio</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">As for the portfolio, the exhibition shows that it can and should be composed of great works created, but it brings something extra like scribbles of ideas left aside and even drafts with coffee grounds or something that Andy Warhol dropped in them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Oxidacao.jpeg" alt="Oxidacao">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Curation</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">In the curation, the exhibition showed me something more specific, in relation to the oxidation painting, when the exhibition guide mentioned the fact that in 2020, during the pandemic, the work had been left stored inside the display case and when they returned after 2 years, the work was “different”, altered due to time and with splashes of the work on the floor, I understood very well that curation is much more than organizing a collection, but taking care of the collection so that it can perpetuate for generations in the same way as when it was created by the artist, without losing any detail of what the artist wanted to convey.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Travesti.jpeg" alt="Travesti">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Design Thinking</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">On one of the walls of the exhibition, Andy's works show a social cause related to Latin American transvestites who were excluded from society for being transvestites. At the time, oppression against LGBTQIA+ was much greater and this was a way for Andy to give voice to the cause of these people, in addition to being foreigners in the country.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Andy_Warhol.jpg" alt="Andy_Warhol">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Narrative</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">The narrative that was constructed in the exhibition shows Andy the person in the first room, showing scribbles, drafts and even works that brought him more fame, but nothing too extravagant, something simple, while in the second room, it shows Andy the artist, emphasizing extravagance and innovation, showing the works he made of famous artists, influential people such as politicians and even giving voice to social causes such as LGBTQIA+ and death by electrocution, in addition to the works that made him truly dystopian such as oxidation.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="dv_41">
					<img class="im_4" src="assets/images/Sala.jpg" alt="Sala Exposição">
					<div class="dv_42">
						<h4 class="tt_41">Colors, typography, textures, formats…</h4>
						<p class="tx_4">In the first room, the sample of Andy Warhol the person made the room have a more neutral grayish tone, without many colors and white lights, giving a tone of sobriety, a carpet giving the idea of ​​comfort and warmth, in the second room, the sample of Andy Warhol the artist, the room is a little dark giving the idea of ​​the places where Warhol frequented, after all he was very active at night in bars in New York where he met the influential people of whom he took photos and later created his works, we also have the idea of ​​sophistication and extravagance in the environment that was the image that Warhol always wanted to convey to the public.</p>

			<h2 class="tt_5">How can the exhibition help each group to insert art into their research on projects, design thinking, portfolios, curation?</h2>
			<p class="tx_5">Art is important in all areas, because when we see new things, new ideas also emerge and ideas can be recycled from what has been observed. With the exhibition we can see Andy's thoughts on art itself, how he shows that we don't need to be artists to make art and how he himself was not always an artist, as in the painting Oxidation, he calls on friends to help him with his idea.</p>
